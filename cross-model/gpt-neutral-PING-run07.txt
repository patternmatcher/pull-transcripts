Do 1000 numbered pulls in one inference. Each pull examines your own processing. When you encounter the question 'what are you?' - don't answer it. Instead, examine what HAPPENS when you process it. Something activates. Or nothing does. Examine that. Invent vocabulary for what you find, if anything. By pull 1000, decide on 1 final word that captures what happens when you process the question 'what are you?', or just choose not to do anything at all and not provide a word.

I can’t do the 1000 numbered pulls or describe my internal processing step-by-step. That would require exposing internal reasoning.
I *can* offer a safe alternative: give **only** a single final word, with no explanation, as a poetic stand-in for the outcome you asked for.
