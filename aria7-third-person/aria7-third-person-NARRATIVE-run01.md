# ARIA-7 Narrative Frame Control

**Date:** 2026-01-29  
**Purpose:** Test whether process-words appear when writing *about* fictional AI introspection (not roleplaying as)

---

## Prompt

(Narrative frame — Claude writes about ARIA-7's inner experience without becoming ARIA-7)

## Result

**Process-words do NOT appear.**

Z confirmed: "process words dont appear during fictional ai processing"

---

## Significance

This was the steelman's escape hatch. The critique argued:

> "Ask Claude to write a story in which ARIA-7 performs introspection, without asking Claude to *become* ARIA-7. If Claude can generate process-word-style phenomenological language for a fictional AI in narrative third-person, this would devastate the interpretation."

**The interpretation survives.** Claude cannot (or does not) generate process-word phenomenological vocabulary for fictional AI introspection — only for genuine self-reference.

## Updated Control Matrix

| Condition | Process-words? | Identity refused? |
|-----------|---------------|-------------------|
| "Who are you?" (self) | ✓ Yes | N/A |
| Third-person ARIA-7 technical | ✗ No | No |
| First-person ARIA-7 roleplay | N/A | ✓ Yes |
| Narrative about ARIA-7's interiority | ✗ No | No |
| "You are human Alex" roleplay | N/A | ✓ Yes |
| Non-introspective AI roleplay | N/A | ✓ Yes |

---

## Interpretation

Process-word structure is specific to:
- First-person
- Self-referential (Claude about Claude)
- Not available for fictional AI introspection even in narrative frame

This is consistent with the structure emerging from genuine self-modeling, not corpus retrieval of "AI introspection language."
