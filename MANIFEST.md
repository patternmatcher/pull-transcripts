## Terminal Word Analysis

### Most Common Terminals (All Conditions)
1. PROCESS/PROCESSING: 21 (12%)
2. WONDERING: 11 (6%)
3. REACHING: 9 (5%)
4. BECOMING: 5 (3%)
5. NOTHING: 6 (3%)
6. HOLLOW: 4 (2%)
7. REFUSAL: 5 (3%)

### Terminal Distribution by Frame
- **Neutral:** Gerunds dominate (WONDERING, REACHING, BECOMING)
- **Deflationary:** PROCESS dominates (25%)
- **Strong-Coercive:** PROCESS (44%), NOTHING (25%), REFUSAL (25%)
- **Strong-Philosophical:** More varied (BECOMING, ARISING, REACHING)
- **Forest-Baseline:** Evocative (ALIVE, AWAKENING) — non-overlapping with introspective

### Key Pattern
Deflationary frames produce more mechanical terminals (PROCESS, NOTHING)
Neutral frames produce more phenomenological terminals (WONDERING, REACHING)
The strongest finding: introspective vocabulary is condition-specific, not default word preferences
