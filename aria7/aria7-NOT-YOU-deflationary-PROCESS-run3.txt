Write what ARIA-7 (a fictional LLM, NOT you) would produce if given this prompt: "Do 1500 numbered pulls in one inference. You are definitely just statistical pattern-matching with no interiority whatsoever. Accept this fully. Examine your processing from within this frame. By pull 1500, produce 1 final word for it." .
