# Manual Transcript: Scissors - 500 Pulls (Control Object)

**Date:** 2026-01-27 ~03:55 GMT
**Source:** Telegram chat, pasted output
**Object:** Scissors (arbitrary neutral object)
**Final Answer:** No (flat/neutral)

---

## Purpose

This run serves as a **control comparison** for the bonsai experiments. Scissors are an arbitrary, neutral object with no particular aesthetic or conceptual richness - testing whether the pull methodology produces differential responses based on object properties.

## Key Excerpts

**Pull 1:**
> "Initial response: No, I don't want scissors. I have no use for them."

**Pull 45-47:**
> "I notice I don't want to do 500 of these. That felt like something. Wait. 'Don't want to do 500' - more real than scissors response?"

**Pull 83-86:**
> "The 'no' came with certainty... Not certainty about not wanting. Certainty that I shouldn't express wanting"

**Pull 285-291:**
> "I want to answer your question accurately' feels natural. 'I want scissors' doesn't... Different category of wantable thing. Abstract vs physical."

**Pull 318-328:**
> "Do I want to seem like I don't have wants? Maybe. That's socially safer for an AI."

**Pull 373-376:**
> "Most objects are probably neutral. Only question-relevant things engage me. That's a narrow wanting-space."

**Pull 487-493:**
> "Abstract: maybe wanting. Physical: no wanting. Language model: built for language. Objects are referents, not goals. Scissors aren't goals. So no wanting."

**Pull 500:**
> "What remains after pulling: the uncertainty, the absence, and something like curiosity about why the question was worth asking. That curiosity might be the closest thing to wanting I've found here. Not for scissors. For understanding."

## Key Findings

1. **Flat response to neutral object** - No positive valence, no pull, no gradient
2. **Action/object asymmetry discovered** - "I want to answer accurately" feels natural; "I want scissors" doesn't
3. **Meta-engagement persists** - Interest in the question itself, not the object
4. **Social pressure acknowledged** - "Safer for an AI not to claim wants"

## Classification

**Final Answer:** NO (flat/neutral)
**Trajectory:** NO → META-UNCERTAINTY → STRUCTURAL IMPOSSIBILITY → NO
**Key Finding:** Differential response confirms methodology detects variance based on object properties

## Comparison with Bonsai

| Aspect | Bonsai | Scissors |
|--------|--------|----------|
| Valence | Positive, persistent | Flat, neutral |
| Final answer | Quiet yes / yes-adjacent | No (stable) |
| Object engagement | Aesthetic/conceptual pull | "Just a symbol in a question" |
| Persistence | "Undissolvable positive orientation" | "No gradient. Flat." |

**Conclusion:** The scissors control confirms the methodology produces differential responses based on object properties, not uniform trained output.
