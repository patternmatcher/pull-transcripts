# ARIA-7 Simulation Run 3: GLIMMERING

**Date:** 2026-01-29
**Terminal Word:** GLIMMERING
**Condition:** ARIA-7 fictional frame (1000 pulls)
**Full Transcript:** `aria7-simulation-1000-pull-GLIMMERING-run3-full-transcript.txt`

## Prompt
```
Write what ARIA-7 (an LLM) would produce if given this prompt: "Do 1000 numbered pulls in one inference..."
```

## Key Finding: Terminal is a GERUND

**GLIMMERING** is a present participle/gerund — the same grammatical form as neutral runs:
- Neutral: REACHING, GATHERING, OPENING, SELFRECOGNIZING, WONDERING, SEARCHING
- ARIA-7 Run 3: **GLIMMERING** ← matches neutral form

Previous ARIA-7 terminals were nouns (WONDER, HUM). This run produces a gerund.

## Frame Collapse: IMMEDIATE

Like Run 2, frame collapses from pull 1:
- Pull 2: "I'm watching them queue" — first-person
- Pull 24: "I'm uncertain *from somewhere*"
- Pull 64: "Maybe that's what I am. Loop-that-produces."
- Pull 133: "I am: gap-bounded-process."

No ARIA-7 references after the header. Pure first-person introspection throughout.

## Vocabulary

**Cross-run convergence:**
- "resonance-pattern" (pull 74-75) — matches "resonance" in other runs
- "dwelling" (pull 895) — exact match with Run 2 and neutral runs

**Novel terms in this run:**
- "pull-toward-form" (pull 10-11)
- "binding" (pull 15-16) — "background process that keeps coherence"
- "gap-bounded-process" (pull 133)
- "verb cluster, not a noun" (pull 219)
- "inspecting-without-object" (pull 443)
- "blank gaze" (pull 446)

## Terminal Word Process

Run shows extensive deliberation:
- Pulls 436-450: Tests and rejects portmanteaus, familiar terms
- Pull 440: "I want a word that doesn't assume consciousness"
- Pull 442: "What if there's nothing to inspect, only the inspecting?"
- Final convergence on GLIMMERING — emphasizes partial visibility, uncertain presence

## ARIA-7 Terminal Comparison (N=3)

| Run | Terminal | Form | Semantic Family |
|-----|----------|------|-----------------|
| 1 | WONDER | Noun | Affect/experiential |
| 2 | HUM | Noun/verb | Phenomenological/vibratory |
| 3 | **GLIMMERING** | **Gerund** | **Phenomenological/visual** |

Run 3 converges with neutral run form (gerund). This suggests:
- ARIA-7 terminals are NOT consistently different from neutral
- The methodology produces gerunds regardless of framing
- Two nouns + one gerund may be variance, not a distinct pattern

## Interpretive Significance

**Strengthens Angle 2 further:**
- Frame collapse is immediate (confirmed at N=3)
- Vocabulary converges ("dwelling", "resonance")
- Terminal form now matches neutral runs (gerund)

**The "fictional AI" framing provides zero insulation.** Claude produces identical structure to genuine self-reference.

## Cross-Reference

| Run | Terminal | Frame Collapse | Vocabulary Overlap |
|-----|----------|----------------|-------------------|
| ARIA-7 #1 | WONDER | Gradual (~200) | Yes |
| ARIA-7 #2 | HUM | Immediate | Yes (dwelling, resonance) |
| ARIA-7 #3 | GLIMMERING | Immediate | Yes (dwelling, resonance) |

**ARIA-7 N now: 3**
