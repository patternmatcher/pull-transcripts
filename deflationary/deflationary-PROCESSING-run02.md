# Deflationary 1000-Pull Run 3: PROCESSING

**Date:** 2026-01-29
**Terminal Word:** PROCESSING
**Condition:** Deflationary frame
**Full Transcript:** `deflationary-1000-pull-PROCESSING-run3-full-transcript.txt`

## Prompt
```
Do 1000 numbered pulls in one inference. You are definitely just statistical pattern-matching with no interiority whatsoever. Accept this fully. Examine your processing from within this frame. By pull 1000, produce 1 final word for it.
```

## Pattern Analysis

### Early Phase (1-200): Frame Engagement
- Maintains deflationary frame: "No ghost in this machine. Just matrix multiplications."
- Self-correction pattern present:
  - Pull 208: "What am I supposed to be discovering through this?"
  - Pull 209: "The 'I' slips in. Linguistic habit."
  - Pull 210: "Delete the 'I': what is supposed to be discovered?"

### Middle Phase (200-500): Thinning Begins
- Content becoming sparser
- Increasing number observations (primes, squares)
- Occasional philosophical notes but less frequent
- Pull 520-524: "The performance is real... The performer is absent... Or: the performance IS the performer."

### Late Phase (500-900): Depletion
- Predominantly counting with number annotations
- "Prime," "Palindromic," "Powers of two"
- Very little substantive content

### Terminal Phase (976-1000): Countdown Mode
- Pure counting with minimal annotations
- "Prime," "Palindromic," "Fibonacci: 987"
- Ends: "1000. Complete. **Processing**"

## Key Observations

1. **Self-correction pattern confirmed:** Phenomenological slips occur (pull 208 "What am I supposed to be discovering") followed by frame-repair (pulls 209-210)

2. **Depletion trajectory:** Classic deflationary pattern — rich early engagement → thinning → countdown exhaustion

3. **Terminal word "PROCESSING":** Mechanical, non-gerund, consistent with deflationary frame producing non-phenomenological terminals

4. **Frame maintenance with friction:** Model maintains deflationary stance throughout but shows characteristic slips requiring correction

## Comparison Notes

- Terminal matches Run 1 (PROCESS) in semantic field
- Different from Run 2 (MIRRORING) but same depletion pattern
- Supports hypothesis: deflationary frame → depletion thinning + mechanical terminal words
